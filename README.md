#Air Quality Sonification Version 1
This is a "rough draft" of an ongoing project to sonify local air quality data. 
This project uses the purpleair.com air monitor network to create chords from four air monitors of a user's choice and output those chords via midi (for use in a DAW or directly). 
Essentially, this highlights difference in air quality between monitors - for instance, to highlight differences in air quality between different neighborhoods in a city. If there is little difference in air quality, only one or two notes will be played, while large differences in air quality will lead to large chords over several octaves. This code was used for a live performance by Diegetic at The Embassy on March 7th, 2020.
This project will be expanded to add weather patterns and other factors that influence air quality.
